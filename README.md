# SimpleWeather

## Summary
This is a <b>.NET</b> 6 project that provides simple means of obtaining weather data from the [OpenWeatherMap's API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

## Status

## Methods
At this point there is only one <b>asynchronous</b> method which returns and Object containing all the data for the current weather in a given city:
```Csharp
GetCurrentWeatherResponse()
```
## Prerequisites

```Json
{
  "openWeatherApiKey": "YourKeyGoesHere"
}
```

## Example usage
```Csharp
using SimpleWeather;

var weatherController = new WeatherController();
var currentWeather = await weatherController.GetCurrentWeatherResponse("Lovech", "metric");


Console.WriteLine($"The current temperature in {currentWeather.City} is {currentWeather.Main.Temperature} degrees.");
```
